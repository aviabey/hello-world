# hello-world
On the way to a big trip. 

    I heard about this GitHub and wanted to take a look. Now I have some interest on this and keep looking foward to get going with GitHub. Actually I want to be a part of programming communities and learn something for me and give something to the world. So good luck with my hope and I'll be in touch with GitHub in the future. 

Thank you.
